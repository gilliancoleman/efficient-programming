This week we will work together on some 'slightly' advanced R concepts, then use these new concepts to perform significance tests for many different fish species by protection level.  We will then follow up any statistically significant tests with pairwise tests.

This a typical analysis you might have already performed...think one-way ANOVA then Tukey pairwise tests, but we will use non-parametric equivalents.

The main functions that will enable us to efficiently crunch all this data are...

-[map()](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html)

## Efficient Programming

1. Examine the 'drto_psu_density.csv' dataset.  It consists of fish density at 605 samples across the Dry Tortugas for ~475 individual species.  The 'PROT' field is a categorical value representing 3 different management areas.

```{r echo=FALSE}

kable(head(drto_psu_density)) %>% 
   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped")
```

2. We are going to first run a Kruskal Wallace test to look for significant differences at the management zone level for each species.  Then filter out all non-significant results.

3. Next we will run Wilcox pairwise tests for all the significant fish species to test which management zone(s) where statistically different for each species.  Then again filter out any non-significant results.
